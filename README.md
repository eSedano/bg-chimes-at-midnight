## Introduction
**Chimes at midnight** is a cooperative abstract strategy game, where two players work together to beat the automated oponent.

## Rquired components
* 1 standard 52-card deck
* 10 pawns (5 white, 5 black)

## Setup
* Devide the deck of cards by suit and remove the court cards from all four suits. This will leave you with just 40 numerical cards, from Ace to ten.
* Shuffle together one red with one black suit, and create a 4x5 grid of face-up cards with them. This will be the playing board, which will be different each time you play.
* Place the white pawns along one of the 5-card edges of the playing board. Place the black pawns along the other 5-cards edge.
* Take the two remaining suits of numerical cards and divide them among thw two players: One player takes the odd black numbers and the even red numbers, while the other player takes the even black numbers and the odd red ones.

Once this is done the setup is complete and the game can begin. Players control the white pawns while the automated opponent controls the black pawns.
